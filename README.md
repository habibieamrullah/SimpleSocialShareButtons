Easy way to add social share buttons with JavaScript

To use it, just include the script this way: 
```
<script src="https://codes.ciihuy.com/simpleshare/simpleShare.js"></script>
```

Then to show the buttons, you can do one of these two ways:

First way, simple on, it only takes one parameter which is a string containing those social media names separated by comma:
```
showSimpleSharer("facebook,twitter,email,pinterest,linkedin,whatsapp,telegram");
```

The second way, in addition it takes another two parameters, custom URL you want to share and a short description text:
```
showCustomSharer("facebook,twitter,email,pinterest,linkedin,whatsapp,telegram", "https://google.com/", "A cool search engine...");
```
